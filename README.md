# COVID-19 Radiology Primer

## What is the purpose of this primer?
The goal of this primer is to provide an engaging, easy-to-use interface for understanding the classic radiologic imagery associated with COVID-19. Currently, the online platform features 46 CT stacks and accompanying case information that we hope medical students and other medical trainees can use.

## Is this project complete?
No, it isn't! Now that this website is set up, we would like to incorporate X-ray imagery, in addition to more CT stacks. If you are a software engineer, web designer, diagnostic radiologist, or other medical imaging expert, please contact us.
