# COVID-19 Radiology Primer

## What is the purpose of this primer?
The goal of this primer is to provide an engaging, easy-to-use interface for understanding the classic radiologic imagery associated with COVID-19. Currently, the online platform features 46 CT stacks and accompanying case information that we hope medical students and other medical trainees can use.

## Where does the dataset come from?
We acquired CT imagery and related case information through Radiopaedia (as part of the Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike 3.0 Unported licence). Dr. Samuel J. Galgano, a faculty radiologist at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, has subsequently reviewed our collection.
